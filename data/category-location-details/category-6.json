        "overview": "Burhanpur is a prominent Mughal-era heritage city known for its historic mosques, forts, royal hammams, and planned urban fabric. The city is especially renowned for its remarkable Mughal-period underground water management system known as Kundi Bhandara (Khooni Bhandara)—an ingenious network of subterranean tunnels, aqueducts, and reservoirs designed to supply water to the city through gravity-based engineering. This sophisticated system reflects Burhanpur's historical importance as a major administrative and military center on the Mughal Deccan route, combining architectural grandeur with advanced hydraulic planning.",
